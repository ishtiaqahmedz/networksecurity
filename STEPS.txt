created nenv,gitignore,readme,requirements.txt, then .github/workflows folder under whihc "main.yaml" file (to use github actions
in future), created network_data folder, and notebooks folder, networksecurity underwhich we created our standard folder structure
along with dockerfile and setup.py etc files. After that, we created ".env" file, for using environment variables for whcih we will
use python-dotenv package. 
Now updated requirements.txt file, and use <pip install -r requirements.txt>. Clicked on AutoSave option under FILE menu, so the 
project get saved in case of any changes. We setup  the packages by creating "__init__.py" file under the created folders. We setup
the git repo locally and on github adn pushed the changes.

* updated setup.py, introduced "-e ." in requirements.txt so setup.py may out python project as package. after completing setup.py,
we ran pip install -r requirements.txt, it installed the packages and in last, due to presence of "-e .", it refered to setup.py,
made instllations of our developed packages as well. 
We can add this "-e ." in last when project is matured, this is comunicated by the teacher however ChatGPT and Co-pilot suggest
to add it at begining of the project.
